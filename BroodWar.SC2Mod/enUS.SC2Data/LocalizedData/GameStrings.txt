Button/Tooltip/AWrp=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Sacrifices 2 High Templar to create an Archon.</c><n/><n/>In times of great peril, High Templar warriors can sacrifice themselves and merge together as a powerful, psionic entity: the Archon.
Button/Tooltip/Academy=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Terran infantry.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Firebats<n/>- Medics</c><n/><n/>The Confederate Marine Corps is always researching new technologies and seeking to improve the quality of its personnel.  The Academy is the primary center of this research.
Button/Tooltip/Aldaris=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">A preeminent Judicator, Aldaris liaises between the Conclave and the leaders of the Templar Caste.</c><n/></n>Aldaris is a strong believer in the Protoss vision of the New Beginning. He holds the virtues of communal achievement and selfless honour above all things. Charged with watching over Tassadar’s command of the expeditionary force, Aldaris was quick to chastise the younger Protoss for his mistakes. Aldaris has no compunction against branding those who do not conform to Protoss dogma as heretics and traitors.
Button/Tooltip/Arbiter=<c val="ffff8a">Aerial support ship. Projects a field that cloaks all friendly units in its range. Can be upgraded to use Stasis Field and Recall. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor Cannon</c><n/><n/>Shrouded in mystery and permeated by latent psionic energy, the lumbering Arbiter ships often accompany Protoss warfleets into battle.<n/><n/>Psychic Judicators crew the Arbiter ships, and they use the Arbiter as a focal point to project a reality-warping field that serves to conceal all friendly units within close proximity. Since the Arbiter must be anchored firmly in space-time to safely generate such a large field, it is immune to the effects and remains visible, even when surrounded by the field of another Arbiter.
Button/Tooltip/Archon=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful psionic attacker. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psionic Shockwave</c><n/><n/>These swirling, burning effigies of the Protoss spirit radiate incalculable power, and their devastating psionic storms can be unleashed against cowering enemy forces both in the air and on the ground. Although the Protoss are loathe to sacrifice valuable Templar, those that do achieve this final level of commitment are honoured in the annals of the Templar Archives.
Button/Tooltip/ArchonWarpTarget=Sacrifices 2 High Templar to create an Archon.
Button/Tooltip/Armory=<c val="ffff8a">Contains weapon and armor upgrades for Factory and Starport units. <n/></n></c>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Goliaths<n/>- Valkyries</c><n/><n/>Within the battered walls of the Armory, Terran researchers and test groups work to develop improved materials for the heavy weapons and armor used by Terran vehicles and starships.
Button/Tooltip/Artanis=<c val="ffff8a">Recently appointed to Praetor, Artanis is a strong and capable warrior and pilot. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Dual Photon Blasters<n/>Anti-Matter Missiles</c><n/><n/>Only 262 years old, Artanis was appointed to the position of Executor at a young age during the Zerg invasion of Aiur, following the apparent defection of the previous Executor, Tassadar. Artanis fought the Zerg alongside his old comrade, Fenix, and earned the title of Praetor soon after the death of the Overmind.<n/><n/>Artanis harbors a deep respect and admiration for Tassadar. He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.
Button/Tooltip/ArtanisProfile=<c val="ffff8a">Recently appointed to Praetor, Artanis is a strong and capable warrior.

He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.
Button/Tooltip/Assimilator=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Warped in over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.</c><n/><n/>The Assimilator is a Protoss building used for harvesting vespene gas. Although materials are usually warped in from Aiur, vespene is still required for these materials to be produced and the creation of warp rifts.
Button/Tooltip/Barracks=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Infantry-production facility.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Marines<n/>- Bunkers</c><n/><n/>The Barracks houses and trains all of the Terran infantry units. Like the Command Center, it is a mobile structure able to traverse great distances in order to reach new hot-zones or deployment centers.
Button/Tooltip/Battlecruiser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful warship. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon (limited availability)</c><n/><n/>The massive, Behemoth-Class Battlecruisers are virtual flying fortresses, built to keep the peace within the Terran Sector. Outfitted with multiple laser batteries and thick NeoSteel armor, these ships are easily the most powerful of the Colonial vessels. Many Colonial generals use Battlecruisers as their command centers during long space campaigns.
Button/Tooltip/Blink=Teleports Fenix to a nearby target location. Ability can only be used once every <d ref="Abil,Blink,Cost[0].Cooldown.TimeUse"/> seconds.
Button/Tooltip/BuildAcademy1=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Infantry specialization facility.

Button/Tooltip/BuildMachineShop=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Factory addon. Allows more Factory units and upgrades.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Siege Tanks</c><n/><n/>The Factory is primarily designed to assemble prefabricated vehicle designs and components. A Machine Shop is necessary to process the parts needed for heavier vehicles and to develop new technology and upgrades for existing vehicle designs.
Button/Tooltip/BuildNuclearSilo=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Command Center add-on. Produces, stores, and launches Nuclear Missiles. Nukes require Ghosts to pinpoint impact location.</c><n/><n/>After the Korhal incident, full-scale nuclear weapons were banned from use on habitable worlds, but smaller tactical nuclear weapons are still used by various Terran armed forces. The Nuclear Silo add-on can produce and house a single tactical nuclear warhead.
Button/Tooltip/BuildPhysicsLab=<c val="ffff8a">Weapon research facility.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Battlecruisers</c><n/><n/>By adding a high-energy particle accelerator and exhaustive diagnostic equipment to an existing Science Facility, Terran scientists have been able to facilitate the development of various technological advancements.
Button/Tooltip/BuildValkyrie=Heavy support fighter. Fires a volley of rocket barrages. <n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Attacks air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/Bunker=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Defensive structure. Infantry fights from inside. Units inside the Bunker gain +1 range.</c><n/><n/>Designed to safeguard troops from enemy fire, Bunkers can be constructed to defend any pivotal location. The bunker typically accommodates, but is not limited to, four individuals. Weapon ports are located on all sides, with ammunition racks above them. Entry and exit is through a single hatch to the rear.
Button/Tooltip/BurrowDown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Buries the unit underground. Burrowed units are unable to move or attack, but they cannot be seen without detection.</c><n/><n/>Most Zerg have the ability to burrow underground to set up ambushes or to protect themselves from air strikes.
Button/Tooltip/BurrowLurker=Buries the Lurker underground. Lurkers cannot attack unless burrowed.
Button/Tooltip/BurrowUp=Returns the unit to the surface.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Most Zerg have the ability to burrow underground to set up ambushes or to protect themselves from air strikes.</c>
Button/Tooltip/Carrier=<c val="ffff8a">Capital ship. Can build and launch Interceptors to make attacks. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Interceptors</c><n/><n/>The massive Carriers serve as command centers for the leaders of the Protoss fleets. Heavily armored and shielded, Carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by unleashing flights of robotic Interceptors at vital enemy targets. Although the Carriers have no weapon batteries or armaments of any kind, their deployment of Interceptor flights makes them devastating in ship to ship battle.
Button/Tooltip/Charge=Fenix can charge towards a unit at high speed.
Button/Tooltip/CharonBoosters=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the range of Goliath Hellfire Missiles.</c><n/><n/>With the Charon Boosters' improved propulsion technology and upgrades to existing targeting system software, the range of the Hellfire missiles can be dramatically increased.
Button/Tooltip/CloakOff=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Decloaks the selected unit, making it visible to enemies.</c>

This ‘invisibility’ has earned the Ghosts a fear-inspired reputation for their mysterious battlefield tactics. Older models of the Ghost Hostile Environment Suit may not be equipped with a personal cloaking device, but they may be retrofitted with them in the field.
Button/Tooltip/CommandCenter=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary structure. Used to receive gathered resources. Can use the Lift Off ability and can build the ComSat Station or the Nuclear Silo add-ons.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- SCVs</c><n/><n/>Command Centers serve as the focal points for all Terran outposts. Originally designed to be roving resource processors for Confederate Prospectors, the Command Centers can pick up stakes and move on to new Mineral or Vespene deposits. They also have the ability to manufacture SCVs and serve as the return point for mining vehicles. Heavily armored and sturdy, the slow moving Command Centers are most vulnerable when they are on the move.
Button/Tooltip/ConstructScarab=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Constructs an explosive Scarab drone. Reavers cannot attack without Scarabs.</c><n/><n/>Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.
Button/Tooltip/Consume=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Defiler feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.</c><n/><n/>As the only breed in the Swarm to show tendencies of cannibalism, the Defiler sometimes feeds off of its own species to regain lost energy. While this practice is particularly repulsive to most civilised species in the galaxy, it has proven to be an effective, if unsavoury, tactic.
Button/Tooltip/Corruptor=Anti-air flyer. Can spray enemies with acid, lowering their defenses.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/Corsair=<c val="ffff8a">Air-superiority fighter. Can be upgraded to use Disruption Web.

Located deep within the Core are the mysterious essence translators that bond the spirits of fallen Protoss to the cold metal exoskeletons of the Dragoons.
Button/Tooltip/Daggoth=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Master of the Tiamat Brood, the largest and most powerful Brood within the Swarm.</c><n/></n>Like all Cerebrates, Daggoth was created to help the Overmind keep control over the Zerg Broods. Commanding the largest Zerg Brood, Tiamat, Daggoth serves the Overmind with ferocity and valour. Daggoth is easily one of the strongest willed Cerebrates, often advising other Cerebrates as to how they might best serve the Overmind.
Button/Tooltip/DarkArchon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful psionic being. Can use Feedback and can be upgraded to use Mind Control and Maelstrom.</c><n/><n/>Like their High Templar brethren, two Dark Templar can sacrifice themselves in a Psionic melding, giving rise to the Dark Archon. The powers of these avatars of Psionic might extend well beyond those of the regular Archon, more than compensating for their lack of any physical attack capability.<n/><n/>The burning, crimson effigy of the Dark Archon spreads fear across any battlefield. These powerful creatures of living Psionic energy embody the eternal wrath of the Dark Templar. The Dark Archon can wield the mysterious energies of the Void. These dire, volatile beings are so powerful that the Dark Templar have outlawed their creation for a thousand years.
Button/Tooltip/DarkArchonWarpSelection=Sacrifices 2 Dark Templar to create a Dark Archon.
Button/Tooltip/DarkArchonWarpTarget=Sacrifices 2 Dark Templar to create a Dark Archon.

By spontaneously launching a number of these creatures into the fray, the Defiler can create a thick cloud of living insects to distract the Swarm’s enemies and provide cover for other Breeds.
Button/Tooltip/DarkTemplar=<c val="ffff8a">Deadly warrior-assassin. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies without detection. Can merge with another Dark Templar to create a Dark Archon. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Warp Blades</c><n/><n/>The Dark Templar are powerful psionic warriors whose ancestors resettled on the planet Shakuras after they were exiled from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur for refusing to join the emerging Khala, the communal mind link shared by the entire race. <n/><n/>In place of the Khala’s bright energies, the Dark Templar learned to manipulate the darker powers of the Void, which gave the Dark Templar the ability to become invisible at will. Armed with their potent Warp Blades, the Dark Templar are deadly and relentless foes capable of devastating conventional forces.

Button/Tooltip/DefensiveMatrix=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a protective shield around a friendly unit for a period of time.</c><n/><n/>Confederate scientists are still working on creating stable, long-term force field generators, but early research has enabled the deployment of a short- lived defensive matrix that can absorb significant punishment. This energy matrix can be created around any unit within a short range of the Explorer.
Button/Tooltip/Defiler=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Venomous specialist unit. Can use Dark Swarm and can be upgraded to use Consume and Plague.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorLightGrey">unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Venom</c><n/><n/>Defilers are the perfect example of the fanatic and sadistic nature of the Zerg. Like the Larvae, the Defiler carries within it the genetic code of every other Zerg breed, but it does not produce them. To the contrary, the Defiler uses these genetic matrices to produce cancer-like toxins which have dramatic and deadly effects on the Zerg.<n/><n/>Although it would seem counter-productive for the Zerg to kill their own troops, the catastrophic effects produced by this forced devolution have been known to destroy legions of enemy troops.

Button/Tooltip/DefilerMound=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Defilers.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Defilers</c><n/><n/>The area around the Defiler’s lair is littered with mineral chunks that have become tainted by the venomous essence of the Defiler itself. The bottom of the Mound is a disgusting pool of cancerous soup strewn with a tangled mass of horribly twisted biological rejects. From this organic poison comes the various venoms that are used by the Defiler as weapons against the enemies of the Swarm.
Button/Tooltip/DevilDog=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Specialized close-range infantry. Works well against light units. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit<n/>Plasma-based Perdition Flame Throwers</c><n/><n/>Cerberus Recon Squad is a black ops unit operating directly under Confederate High Command. There is no mention of the unit in any official military records.
Button/Tooltip/Devourer=<c val="ffff8a">Aerial terror. Can spray acid on enemies to lower their defenses. Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Mantis Screamer</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Corrosive Acid</c><n/><n/>Devourers are an evolution of the Mutalisk. More resilient than the Mutalisk, the Devourer and its corrosive acid is the Swarm's answer to the capital ships of the Terran and the Protoss.
Button/Tooltip/DevourerCocoon=This cocoon contains a Mutalisk as it is morphing into a Devourer.
Button/Tooltip/DevouringOne=<c val="FFFF8A">Rare strain of Zergling.

Valued by Zerg agents for their increased survivability, a main weakness of ordinary Zerglings.
Button/Tooltip/DisruptionWeb=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a net of energy on the ground that prevents any unit or structure underneath from attacking.</c><n/><n/>Corsair pilots can focus their psychic energy through the vessel's Neutron Emitter, creating psionic static which disrupts neural impulses and renders computer-directed attacks inaccurate. The web is drawn towards the magnetic resonance found in ores and minerals. This static prevents all ground units and base defenses from attacking while they remain under it.
Button/Tooltip/Drone=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Basic worker unit. Can harvest minerals and vespene gas. Can mutate into structures. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Gashyrr Wasp</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Spines</c><n/><n/>The savage Gashyrr Wasps of Eldersthine were initially inducted into the Swarm to serve as resource gatherers. Over time they became Drones, engineered with the Larvae’s ability to break down their own genetic coding and transform themselves into rudimentary Zerg structures. A transforming Drone needs the Creep to provide nourishment and mass to support its new form. <n/><n/>Like the Larvae, Drones are controlled by the Overlords who monitor their progress through a type of instinctive telepathy. Drones are also unusually single-minded about their tasks, diligently working even through raging combat.
Button/Tooltip/Dropship=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Air transport vehicle.</c><n/><n/>Heavily armored Dropships are a vital part of Colonial defense and are fully rated for both atmospheric and deep space flight. The daredevil pilots of these sometimes faulty, unreliable ships are charged with delivering Marine armor and infantry to any hotspot or combat zone. True to its name, the Dropship is capable of extremely rapid deployment. <n/><n/>Early experiments in equipping Dropships with weapons systems were scrapped in favour of greater carrying capacity.
Button/Tooltip/Dugalle=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Gerard DuGalle is a highly decorated Admiral in the United Earth Directorate and a lifelong friend of his executive officer, Alexei Stukov.</c><n/><n/>DuGalle has spent most of his life defending Earth from its enemies.

DuGalle was unanimously nominated to command the UED expeditionary force, tasked with pacifying the Koprulu sector and removing the alien threat by any means necessary.
Button/Tooltip/Duke=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Commanding officer of Alpha Squadron.</c><n/><n/>General Edmund Duke has been a stalwart defender of the Confederacy for over forty years. Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things ‘by the book’. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Duke’s ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.
Button/Tooltip/Duran=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">An anti-Dominion operative. Joined the UED shortly after they arrived in the Koprulu Sector.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">25mm C-10 Canister Rifle<n/>Personal Cloaking Device</c><n/><n/>A mysterious character, Samir Duran leads a small commando squad who call themselves the Confederate Resistance Forces. Claiming to have served in Alpha Squadron before the fall of the Confederacy, Duran is dedicated to his ultimate goal of bringing down Mengsk and his new Terran Dominion.
Button/Tooltip/DuranConsume=Duran feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.
Button/Tooltip/EMP=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates an electromagnetic pulse that drains all energy and shields from units in the targeted area.</c><n/><n/>By generating a massive, short-ranged electromagnetic pulse, the Explorer can disable shields and special electronics on any nearby units.

Button/Tooltip/Ensnare=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Thick mucus that temporarily slows down all units in the target area.</c><n/><n/>The Queen sprays her victims with a thick mucus that slows down advancing (or retreating) forces. This biological film will eventual dissolve.
Button/Tooltip/Ensnare2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Thick mucus that temporarily slows down all units in the target area.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan sprays her victims with a thick mucus that slows down advancing (or retreating) forces. This biological film will eventual dissolve.
Button/Tooltip/EvolutionChamber=<c val="ffff8a">Contains upgrades for Zerg ground units.</c> <n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Spore Colonies</c><n/><n/>The Overmind knows that complacency is the road to defeat, and it works constantly to further evolve its children and make them more efficient killers. The Evolution Chamber provides a testing ground for the Overmind to manipulate the genetic code of its lesser spawn, gifting them with enhanced physical abilities.
Button/Tooltip/EvolveEnsnare=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Queen ability. Spray a thick mucus that slows down units. This biological film will eventually dissolve.</c><n/><n/>The Queen vomits forth spores that secrete a sticky mucous, slowing any units that become enmeshed in her gelatinous trap.
Button/Tooltip/EvolveInfestorEnergyUpgrade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of Queens by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>By increasing the reproductive rate of the symbiotic and parasitic creatures that serve the Queen, her ability to spawn these creatures is augmented.
Button/Tooltip/EvolveSpawnBroodling=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Queen ability. Launches a small glob of spores at an enemy non-robotic ground unit. Instantly splits the unit into two Broodlings which attack nearby enemies.</c><n/><n/>The Queen spawns Broodlings by first infesting her victim with self-replicating spores. Upon maturation, the Broodlings erupt from their host and search for new enemies.
Button/Tooltip/EvolveVentralSacks=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows Overlords to transport units.</c><n/><n/>Overlords can be genetically altered to develop large areas on their underbodies that are capable of carrying other Zerg.
Button/Tooltip/Extractor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Mutated over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.</c><n/><n/>Zerg rely on the high-energy state of Vespene gas to power their incredible metabolisms and fuel the accelerated growth of their larvae. The Extractor is essentially a giant organ that sits atop a Vespene geyser and packages the gas into small flesh-wrapped sacs that can be easily carried by Drones to a nearby Hatchery for absorption. Since the Extractor lives on Vespene gas itself, it does not need to be built on an area already covered in Creep.
Button/Tooltip/Factory=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Vehicle-production facility.</c> <n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Vultures</c><n/><n/>The massive, automated Factory is the primary production center for all Terran ground-based vehicles, from the speedy Vulture to the massive Siege Tank. Factories are heavily armored and mobile, but their tremendous import to a strong military presence makes them likely targets for enemy forces.
Button/Tooltip/Feedback=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Drains all energy from the target. Deals 1 damage per point of energy.</c><n/><n/>Dark Archons can manipulate raw psychic energy to cause damage by turning the energy of a target against itself.

He is both cunning and powerful and has fought against the enemies of the Protoss in countless battles. Capable of strong empathy and tremendous rage, Fenix has long been one of Tassadar’s greatest supporters.<n/><n/>Fenix is distrustful of Aldaris and the Judicator caste, and thus relies only upon the honor of his fellow Templar warriors and his own unparalleled skill in the theater of battle.
Button/Tooltip/FenixDragoon=<c val="ffff8a">Praetor of the Protoss Defense Forces and a venerated and honorable warrior, Fenix embodies the very essence of the Protoss and what they stand for.

He is both cunning and powerful and has fought against the enemies of the Protoss in countless battles. Capable of strong empathy and tremendous rage, Fenix has long been one of Tassadar’s greatest supporters.<n/><n/>Having fallen to the Zerg, Fenix was encased in a Dragoon exoskeleton so he could continue to serve Aiur.
Button/Tooltip/Firebat=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy close-range infantry. Works well against light units. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit<n/>Plasma-based Perdition Flame Throwers</c><n/><n/>Like standard Marine Infantry, Firebats are typically “culturally challenged persons” who have been Resocialised. Equipped with powerful, arm-mounted flame throwers, they serve as assault troopers in the various Terran Militias.<n/><n/>Firebat Combat Suits provide additional protection from heat and flame, although they are significantly heavier than standard Marine armour.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit<n/>Plasma-based Epyon Incinerator Cannon</c><n/><n/>The news of aliens running rampant in the Koprulu Sector caused panic on Earth. The fate of the distant colonies mattered little to the UED, but the Zerg and the Protoss were the most dangerous threat the Earth had ever known. An expeditionary fleet was quickly formed with the best soldiers, generals and scientists of the Directorate.<n/><n/>The fleet's first objective was to complete the unification of Humanity by taking control of the Terran colonies. Then, the UED would command as many Zerg as possible through the weak, second Overmind and use them as weapons. The plan included a final step, the pacification of the Protoss, after the Zerg and the Terran were firmly brought under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/FleetBeacon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Scouts, Carriers and Corsairs.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Carriers</c><n/><n/>Easily recognised, the Fleet Beacon is built around a huge sphere painstakingly carved from the largest and purest of Khaydarin crystals.

Button/Tooltip/Forge=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains weapon and armor upgrades for Protoss ground units and shield upgrades for all Protoss units and structures.<n/><n/>Enables:</c><n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Photon Cannons</c><n/><n/>Even though their technology is incredibly advanced when compared to that of other species, the Protoss constantly strive to enhance and refine their weapons and armor. Work at the great Forge rarely ceases, as this edifice is where much of this research takes place.
Button/Tooltip/Forge2=Contains weapon and armor upgrades for Protoss ground units and shield upgrades for all Protoss units and structures.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Photon Cannons from Probes
Button/Tooltip/Gateway=<c val="ffff8a">Warps in Protoss ground units.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Zealots</c><n/><n/>The swirling rift at the centre of the massive Gateway is where the highly trained Protoss ground troops can be warped in from their Homeworld of Aiur.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Hostile Environment Suit<n/>25mm C-10 Canister Rifle<n/>Personal Cloaking Device (special issue)</c><n/><n/>Ghosts epitomise the height of human evolution and physical conditioning. Born with incredible psionic potential, these agents are quarantined and trained from infancy to channel their psionic energies to augment their natural physical strength and endurance. As a precautionary measure, Psychic Dampeners are surgically implanted in all Ghosts.
Button/Tooltip/Goliath=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy-fire support unit. Excells at ground-to-air combat. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Twin 30mm Autocannons<n/>Hellfire Anti-Air Missiles</c><n/><n/>The Goliaths, manufactured by LarsCorp Technologies, were originally built for the Kel-Morian Combine to serve as infantry support. Corporate saboteurs stole the plans and sold them to Confederate interests, and to this day the Goliath is well-known along the Rim.<n/><n/>Featuring all-terrain maneuverability and a computer-based heavy-weapons systems, the Goliath is equally adept at providing both ground level and anti-air support. The use of Goliaths in the infamous Kel-Morian Mining Revolts showed just how effective even a small number of these versatile Combat Walkers can be when engaged in intensive urban warfare.
Button/Tooltip/GreaterSpire=<c val="ffff8a">Contains upgrades for Zerg air units.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Guardians<n/>- Devourers</c><n/><n/>The armored Greater Spire carries the genetic code for the deadliest Zerg flyers and can be used to further enhance and evolve existing breeds. This structure enables the deadly Mutalisk to transform into its Guardian aspect, in which it sacrifices its speed and aerial assault to gain the ability to attack ground based enemies with devastating effect.
Button/Tooltip/Guardian=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Flying heavy-assault unit. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Mantis Screamer</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Explosive Acid</c><n/><n/>A secondary form of the Mutalisk, believed to be based on the nesting form of the Mantis Screamer. The Guardian's explosive acid makes it one of the most deadly weapons of the Swarm. Guardians have a thicker armored carapace and are noticeably slower than Mutalisks, and as such they are used primarily to defend the vulnerable Zerg Larvae.
Button/Tooltip/GuardianNew=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Flying heavy-assault unit.

Button/Tooltip/HallucinationHighTemplar=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates copies of a target unit. These copies function like the original unit, but they cannot use active abilities, cannot deal damage, and die more easily. Hallucinations last <d ref="Behavior,HallucinationTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds before they disappear.</c><n/><n/>It is rumoured that some High Templar have learned to create illusionary duplicates of other beings. While these phantasms have no physical substance, they can be used to draw fire away from friendly units or sow confusion amongst enemy forces.
Button/Tooltip/Hatchery=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary structure. Used to spawn all Zerg units and receive gathered resources. Grows creep used to feed nearby Zerg structures. Can mutate into a Lair.</c><n/><n/>The Hatchery is the heart of any Zerg cluster. It acts not only as a resource return point and processing centre, but it produces the Larvae from which all other Zerg are spawned. Larvae are produced at a steady rate and will stay near the Hatchery of their creation. Like all Zerg structures, Hatcheries are living organisms that heal damage over time, making them very difficult to eradicate.<n/><n/>The Hatchery is the only structure that can be built without the benefit of existing Creep since it has been genetically designed to automatically produce enough to fuel its own growth. Creep Colonies, however, are required to extend this bio-matter further.
Button/Tooltip/Heal=Heals a friendly biological target.<n/><n/><c val="f078ff"> Heals 2 life per 1 energy.</c>
Button/Tooltip/HighTemplar=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Potent psionic master. Can be upgraded to use Hallucination and Psionic Storm. Can merge with another High Templar to create an Archon.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psi Assault</c><n/><n/>The High Templar are seasoned, veteran warriors of the Protoss armies. Respected and honoured throughout the Protoss Empire for their bravery and prowess, the Templar are ever vigilant against threats to the Protoss Homeworld of Aiur.<n/><n/>The High Templar have sacrificed the principles of martial training in order to more perfectly command the awesome psionic abilities that define their station.
Button/Tooltip/HighTemplar2=<c val="ffff8a">A formerly high-ranking Executor in the Protoss armada, Tassadar was stripped of his rank after disobeying orders to annihilate Terrans in the same manner as Zerg. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Tassadar exemplifies the growing rift within Protoss society. Born into a new generation that looks ahead to a dynamic future, Tassadar is frustrated by the stoic view that his elders hold of the past. Tassadar feels that the unbending nature of the Protoss and their inability to re-evaluate ancient traditions will be the doom of his race.<n/><n/>Fascinated by the power and mysticism of the renegade Dark Templar caste, Tassadar hopes to find some way to bridge the gap between these exiles and his masters.
Button/Tooltip/Hive=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Further evolved version of the Hatchery that allows additional upgrades and structures to be produced. Also spawns all Zerg units and receives gathered resources.</c><n/><n/>The most evolved form of the Hatchery is the Hive. Protected by a dense exoskeleton and granted full access to the Overmind’s pool of knowledge, a Hive enables its cluster to produce the most sophisticated breeds and structures to be found within the Swarm.
Button/Tooltip/HunterKiller=<c val="ffff8a">Special Hydralisk strain.

They sometimes serve as bodyguards for important Zerg entities.
Button/Tooltip/Hydralisk=<c val="ffff8a">High-damage ranged unit. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Needle Spines</c><n/><n/>The peaceful, herbivore herds of Slothien were assimilated into the Zerg Swarm in order to produce one of the most fierce and diabolical of the Zerg strains. The evolutionary matrix of the caterpillar-like Slothien was supercharged by the Overmind, twisting the hapless creatures into the nightmarish killers known as Hydralisks. These once mild creatures now hunger for blood and violence, and they are infamous for acting in a particularly sadistic fashion.<n/><n/>The spindly, snake-like Hydralisks house hundreds of armour piercing spines within their upper carapace plates. These spines can be fired in volleys at enemies approaching from either the ground or the air, and massed groups of Hydralisks should be approached with extreme caution.
Button/Tooltip/HydraliskDen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Hydralisks</c><n/><n/>The Hydralisk Den bears only a passing resemblance to the nests of the once-peaceful Slothien that the Hydralisks were evolved from. The slime-covered walls of this vile place contain within them the knowledge necessary for a Hive cluster to produce Hydralisk warriors.
Button/Tooltip/Hyperion=<c val="ffff8a">Previously Mengsk's flagship, the Hyperion was stolen by Raynor after the fall of Tarsonis. </c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon</c><n/><n/>The Hyperion was originally a Confederate battlecruiser, which crash-landed on a fiery planet near Umojan Protectorate territory. Umojan forces secured the crash site and removed its tracking beacon. Over the next year, the battlecruiser was upgraded and modified slowly and methodically.<n/><n/>In 2491 the ship became part of Arcturus Mengsk's Rebellion of Korhal – Mengsk had allied with the Umojan Protectorate and was currently located at Umoja. As the Sons of Korhal was formed, the Hyperion became Mengsk's flagship.<n/><n/>During the assault on Tarsonis, Captain Jim Raynor and his troops defected from the Sons of Korhal. Desperately needing transport, Raynor's group headed to the Dylarian Shipyards of Dylar IV. The Hyperion was sent to stop them, but Raynor's forces were able to board and hijack the ship. The Hyperion now serves as the Raiders' mobile headquarters.
Button/Tooltip/IncreaseCarrierCapacity=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum number of Interceptors that a Carrier can produce, store and launch from 4 to 8.</c><n/><n/>This upgrade refits the Carrier with additional fighter bays.
Button/Tooltip/IncreaseReaverCapacity=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the number of Scarabs that a Reaver can produce, store and fire from 5 to 10.</c><n/><n/>By installing a neoteric micro-manufacturing plant, the Reaver can increase the number of Scarabs that are stored within its hull.
Button/Tooltip/Infest=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Queen is able to infest a badly damaged Command Center. Once infested, the Command Center will be under your command and can produce explosive Infested Terrans.</c><n/><n/>The most feared of the Queen’s abilities is the power to Infest a Terran Command Center and bring its occupants under the Overmind’s control. The Queen must enter a badly damaged Command Center and saturate it with parasitic bio-toxins. Once infested, the Command Center’s occupants can be turned into mindless suicide soldiers.

After his time in the Confederate Marine Corps and subsequent life as an outlaw, Raynor spent many years keeping the peace on the colony of Mar Sara. As Confederate enforcements became increasingly harsh, Raynor decided to join up with the Sons of Korhal.<n/><n/>Although he is new to the movement, Raynor has proven himself to be a dynamic leader and he is well liked and respected by the troops under his command. Despite his often sarcastic demeanour, Jim is fiercely loyal to the Sons of Korhal and will put it all on the line without hesitation.

Eventually Vanderspool openly turned against his men. During a confrontation, Raynor shot Vanderspool in the chest.<n/><n/>Raynor and the other surviving members of Heaven's Devils abandoned the military and were charged with manslaughter in absentia. Following the war, they became outlaws, conducting heists across the Koprulu sector. Years later, Raynor came in contact with Myles Hammond, an old family friend and magistrate of the colony of Mar Sara. Being in a position to grant clemency to Raynor and erase his military and criminal records, Hammond offered Raynor a job as Colonial Marshal. Raynor accepted the offer.

The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss.<n/><n/>Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was succesfully infested, and she adopted the title "Queen of Blades". Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.

This allows Zerg Drones to metamorph into more complex structures, which in turn provide the genetic code needed by Larvae to metamorph into new breeds.
Button/Tooltip/Larva=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Morphs into Zerg units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>The closest creatures to the original Zerg insectoids are the Zerg Larvae. Although their size and toughness were greatly boosted by the Xel’Naga during their experiments, they still possess the two traits that originally intrigued the ancient masters: genetic versatility and psychic sensitivity. <n/><n/>Each larva contains within it the genetic makeup of every other Zerg breed. A young hive will only have the genetic code for the most basic of Zerg breeds, such as the Drone, but as it grows and develops new structures, the larvae can expand their library of genetic strains. With a command from the Overmind, the larvae will enter a pupal state and begin the metamorphosis into whichever breed is required by the hive.

A fascist police state, the UPL ruled ruthlessly, killing millions of humans whose mutations or cybernetic enhancements were considered impure - though the public never knew the scope of the genocide they perpetrated. In spite of all that, the UPL managed to develop warp technology and established several colonies in the Solar System. They eventually launched the supercarriers that would end up stranded in the Koprulu Sector.<n/><n/>After the citizens of Earth discovered the existence of aliens in 2499, the UPL forced the last independent countries into submission and took the name of the United Earth Directorate.

Button/Tooltip/Mengsk=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Leader of the rebel group Sons of Korhal.</c><n/><n/>Arcturus Mengsk was once a successful Prospector for the Confederate government. Although his homeworld, Korhal IV, was a hotbed of civil violence and anti-Confederate sentiment, Arcturus served his government with courage and honor. As the civil turmoil reached the boiling point on Korhal, the Confederates launched a salvo of Apocalypse-Class nuclear missiles at the inflamed colony. Korhal IV was devastated, leaving Arcturus with only ghosts of the family and life he once knew. He immediately resigned his Prospector commission and vowed to bring down the Confederate government that destroyed his life. Gathering many of the survivors of the Korhal catastrophe, Arcturus founded a militant terrorist group known as the Sons of Korhal to aid him in bringing down the hated Confederates.<n/><n/>In his efforts to undermine Confederate authority, Mengsk’s methods and tactics range from harsh to nefarious. Heralded by radicals as a visionary and a patriot, Mengsk is seen by the Confederacy as a terrorist and a madman.
Button/Tooltip/MindControl=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Permanently converts targeted enemy unit to player control.</c><n/><n/>Mind control is a type of psionic power. Protoss Judicators could use their powers to subtly influence the minds of other creatures. Dark Archons, however, through an immense expenditure of energy, are able to project a portion of their psychic essence into another being, gaining control over its actions and access to its memories.
Button/Tooltip/MineralField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest resources from this Mineral Field.</c><n/><n/>The planets along the rim are often dotted with clusters of precious Mineral crystals. These Minerals are smelted down and used to create the armored hulls of starships, vehicles and personal armor.

Like the Larvae, the Defiler carries within it the genetic code of every other Zerg breed, but it does not produce them. To the contrary, the Defiler uses these genetic matrices to produce cancer-like toxins which have dramatic and deadly effects on the Zerg.<n/><n/>Although it would seem counter-productive for the Zerg to kill their own troops, the catastrophic effects produced by this forced devolution have been known to destroy legions of enemy troops.
Button/Tooltip/MuscularAugments=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>Hydralisks can be genetically altered for increased musculature such that their rate of locomotion is greatly enhanced.

Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things ‘by the book’. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Duke’s ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.

VI Canister Rifle</c><n/><n/>Brought into the Confederate Ghost program as a child, Kerrigan was never given the chance for a normal life. The neural processing treatments that were used to dampen and pacify her latent psychic powers left her a withdrawn and introverted young girl. Forced to murder countless enemies of her Confederate masters, Kerrigan was finally exposed to a series of clandestine experiments conducted by the Confederate Government.<n/><n/>During a raid on a remote Terran outpost, Arcturus Mengsk discovered and rescued Kerrigan from the Confederate scientists. The Confederates had ruined both their lives, and it was a simple matter to convince the young woman to lend her formidable combat skills to his cause. Although Kerrigan is often called upon to be an executioner, she has never fully embraced the darker aspect of her true nature.

Button/Tooltip/NydusCanal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Friendly ground units can use a Nydus Canal to instantly travel to any other Canal within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery. The initial canal entrance is created and then, when a suitable site is found, a sister entrance can be opened. The Canal then enables Zerg ground units to travel from one end to the other at extremely high speed regardless of intervening terrain.<n/><n/>This enables multiple Hatcheries located across a large area to function as one unified nest, with Zerg warriors travelling from one combat zone to another quickly and efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/Observatory=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Observers.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Observers</c><n/><n/>History is of vital importance to the Protoss, as they believe that great events echo across space-time and serve as lessons for those wise enough to study them. Even during the Aeon of Strife, Protoss scribes recorded the wars and their heroes for future reference.<n/><n/>The Observatory is a modern refinement of the ancient scribe library, and it is here that the data gathered by the robot Observers is recorded and catalogued for study by future generations of Protoss.
Button/Tooltip/Observer=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Flying spy.

Their complex sensor array leaves little energy for defenses, but they can detect cloaked or concealed units with ease, making them invaluable on the battlefield.<n/><n/>Observers that are used for deep-space exploration are often deployed without any defensive systems, but when used in a combat zone they are equipped with a micro-cloaking field to hide them from the enemy. Like the Arbiter, the Observer does not require any additional energy to maintain the field.
Button/Tooltip/OmegaStorm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a storm that deals damage to enemies in an area.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan can concentrate enough psionic energy to summon a deadly psionic storm, a technique resembling that of the Protoss High Templar.

Button/Tooltip/Overlord=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to create more units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Gargantis Proximae</c><n/><n/>The semi-intelligent, space-faring behemoths known as the Gargantis Proximae were inducted into the Swarm so that their heightened senses could benefit Zerg warriors in battle. The Gargantis flyers were assimilated into the Swarm so well that the Cerebrates use them to maintain control over their forces. Overlords keep the warriors of the swarm ordered and coordinated during battle, and with their enhanced senses they often serve as advanced scouts. They have the innate ability to sense any hidden enemy units, including those under the effects of cloaking systems or distortion fields.<n/><n/>In addition to commanding troops against their enemies, the Overlords also have the responsibility of transporting Zerg warriors within the hollows of their reinforced carapace hides. Only larger Zerg nests seem to have this particular breed of Overlord, but it is generally a good idea to kill these creatures on sight for safety’s sake.
Button/Tooltip/Overmind=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The collective sentience of the Zerg Swarm.</c><n/><n/>Created several millennia ago by the enigmatic Xel’Naga, the Overmind represents the collective consciousness of the Zerg race. Believing that it exists to become the perfect life-form by assimilating the strongest species in the universe, the Overmind is obsessed with its sacred mission. Brilliant and cunning in the extreme, the Overmind will stop at nothing to ensure its success.<n/><n/>The Overmind has the deepest respect for the Protoss, whom it believes to be the greatest species it has sought to conquer. The inevitable conflict with the Protoss will be its ultimate test.
Button/Tooltip/Overmind2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Cerebrates are among the few Zerg with a unique personality. They relay the Overmind's will, commanding their Broods and directing minions in battle.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>Cerebrates were descended from the original Zerg parasites of Zerus that existed before the coming of the Xel'Naga, albeit being much larger and endowed with much greater intelligence. Upon their creation by the Overmind, each Cerebrate and the Brood it led was given a specific role which in turn shaped the Cerebrate's personality. Cerebrates also oversaw the evolution of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Cerebrates further expanded the Zerg hierarchy and came to rely on Queens to oversee hive activity and Overlords to relay commands to and directly control the Brood's minions. While the rigid hierarchy ensured efficiency, the permanent death of a Cerebrate could induce a complete reversal. Broods that lost their Cerebrate frequently became uncontrollably destructive. <n/><n/>Externally, Cerebrates appeared as giant, bloated slug-larvae with numerous purple limbs protruding from the sides.
Button/Tooltip/Parasite=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Attaches a tiny parasite to another unit, allowing the player to see whatever the affected unit sees.</c><n/><n/>By attaching a tiny, remora-like parasite to another unit, the Queen can allow the Overmind to see through the eyes of the enemy. The parasite is not readily visible and once detected can only be removed by killing its host.

Raszagal was captured by Conclave agents and eventually banished from Aiur along with the other Rogues. She had survived only because the Templar Executor, Adun had shown her mercy.<n/><n/>Raszagal eventually became leader of the Dark Templar tribes on Shakuras. At 1045 years of age, she is one of the oldest living Protoss, and remains one of the few Dark Templar old enough to clearly remember Aiur from before their exile. With age, however, Raszagal's control over her powers has begun to slip.

Button/Tooltip/ScientistUED=As the the government that would become the UED took control of most the Earth, it launched a massive campaign of "racial purification" against those who had developed minor mutations or replaced part of their body with mechanical implants. Millions died, until a high-profile UPL scientist, Doran Routhe, decided to use the expendable prisoners to found colonies beyond the Solar System.<n/><n/>Four supercarriers were sent to a nearby star system, but a computer malfunction deleted the coordinates. The supercarriers flew past their intended destination into outer space. The AI that controlled the supercarriers kept performing analysis on the prisoners' DNA, and realized that a few generations of interbreeding might suffice for the colonists to develop psionic capabilities. Ghosts are the finest example of these human psychics. <n/><n/>After twenty-eight years of warp travel, vital supplies ran low and emergency protocols took over. The supercarriers crash-landed on planets that would be known as Tarsonis, Moria and Umoja - the first Terran colonies.

Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another. Unlike DuGalle however, Stukov spent most of his military career in top-secret research rather than in actual combat, constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare. His views on the subject were considered "unconventional."<n/><n/>The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector changed the UPL's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure. Now serving the United Earth Directorate, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control.

They will take damage and have increased attack speed as normal.</c><n/><n/>The newest versions of the Marine Powered Combat Suit and Firebat Heavy Combat Suit feature an in-field chemical delivery system filled with a powerful mixture of synthetic adrenaline and endorphins coupled with a powerful psychotropic aggression amplifier. When activated, the StimPack provides the user with greatly increased speed and reflexes. Some tissue damage may result. <n/><n/>Side effects including insomnia, weight loss, tremors, grand mal seizures, mania/hypomania, paranoiac hallucinations, severe internal hemorrhaging and cerebral deterioration have all been declared nominal and well within Confederate acceptable safety margins.<n/>
Button/Tooltip/Stimpack=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Marine and Firebat ability. Stimpacks cause damage to the unit using them, but they increase its attack and movement speeds for a short time.</c><n/><n/>The newest versions of the Marine Powered Combat Suit and Firebat Heavy Combat Suit feature an in-field chemical delivery system filled with a powerful mixture of synthetic adrenaline and endorphins coupled with a powerful psychotropic aggression amplifier. When activated, the StimPack provides the user with greatly increased speed and reflexes. Some tissue damage may result. <n/><n/>Side effects including insomnia, weight loss, tremors, grand mal seizures, mania/hypomania, paranoiac hallucinations, severe internal hemorrhaging and cerebral deterioration have all been declared nominal and well within Confederate acceptable safety margins.
Button/Tooltip/Stukov=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Alexei Stukov is the Vice-Admiral of the UED fleet and longtime friend of Admiral DuGalle.</c><n/><n/>Stukov grew up on Earth, rising through the ranks of the United Powers League alongside his friend Gerard DuGalle. Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another. Unlike DuGalle however, Stukov spent most of his military career in top-secret research rather than in actual combat, constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare. His views on the subject were considered "unconventional."<n/><n/>The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector changed the UPL's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure. Now serving the United Earth Directorate, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/SupplyDepot=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to create more units.</c><n/><n/>The Supply Depot houses all of the goods, tools, and accessories that are necessary in the day-to-day running of Terran outposts. As various encampments grow and prosper, it is necessary to provide an ever-increasing amount of supplies for colonists and military forces alike.
Button/Tooltip/TemplarArchive=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for High Templar and Dark Archons.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- High Templar<n/>- Dark Templar<n/>- Archons<n/>- Dark Archons</c><n/><n/>The Templar Archives are dark, mysterious buildings that serve as training centers for the legions of the High Templar. These honoured warriors, charged with wielding the awesome psionic powers of their race, use the Archives to directly commune with their ancient ancestors and thereby gain knowledge inaccessible to ordinary warriors.
Button/Tooltip/Tosh=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">An anti-Dominion operative. Joined the UED shortly after they arrived in the Koprulu Sector. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">25mm C-10 Canister Rifle<n/>Personal Cloaking Device</c><n/><n/>A mysterious character, Samir Duran leads a small commando squad who call themselves the Confederate Resistance Forces. Claiming to have served in Alpha Squadron before the fall of the Confederacy, Duran is dedicated to his ultimate goal of bringing down Mengsk and his new Terran Dominion.
Button/Tooltip/TwilightCouncil=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Sacred learning and research center. Contains the Leg Enhancement upgrade for Zealots.</c><n/><n/>The ultimate goal of all Protoss warriors is to achieve the highest level of Khala. To this end they spend much of their time in deep meditation and sparring with each other in the floating Citadels. Named for one the greatest masters of the Khala, the Citadels of Adun are centers of learning and research for acolyte warriors.
Button/Tooltip/U238Shells=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the attack range of Marines.</c><n/><n/>These depleted uranium shells are designed to provide a greater firing range for the C-14 Gauss Rifle carried by Marines.
Button/Tooltip/Ultralisk= <c val="ffff8a">Heavy assault beast. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brontolith</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Kaiser Blades</c><n/><n/>Bearing little resemblance to the docile Brontolith that they were evolved from, the dreaded Ultralisk is the most powerful of the Zerg ground forces. They serve as the backbone of the Swarm’s armies and should be considered as dangerous as any armored vehicle. These massive monstrosities are used as living battering rams against all manner of enemies. The best way to approach these creatures is from the air.
Button/Tooltip/UltraliskCavern=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Ultralisks.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Ultralisks</c><n/><n/>Deep within the shelled Cavern are numerous high-radiation deposits and dangerous substances. The extremely hostile environment within the cavern is what gives the mighty Ultralisk its unearthly toughness. Its genetic material has been subjected to countless tests and experiments, and only the final, viable code is used to provide Zerg Larvae with the key necessary to metamorph into a new Ultralisk.
Button/Tooltip/UseLockdown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fires an electromagnetic round that temporarily disables a mechanical or robotic unit.</c><n/><n/>The C-10 Canister Rifle can be armed with special Lockdown rounds that temporarily disable mechanised units caught within the blast. The Lockdown shell must be charged with a small amount of energy before use.
Button/Tooltip/UseRestoration=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Advanced medical nano-tech procedure. Removes the effects of Parasite, Ensnare, Plague, Corrosive Acid, Maelstrom, Lockdown, Optical Flare, and Irradiate from a target unit.</c><n/><n/>UED Medics have advanced tools at their disposal, and are able to administer effective treatment for most harmful effects using chemical modifiers, nano-conveyed anesthetic and attenuated lasers to carry out on-site surgery.
Button/Tooltip/UseStasisField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Projects a field which holds units in the area immobile for a period of time. While in stasis, units cannot move, attack, be attacked, use abilities, or interact in any way.</c><n/><n/>In addition to destabilising the very fabric of the universe to generate its distortion field, some Arbiters are capable of strengthening discrete pockets of space-time. Anything caught within these absolute pockets is beyond the reach of any normal interaction, friendly or otherwise. Units trapped in a stasis field can neither move nor attack, and are completely immune to the effects of damage and special abilities.
Button/Tooltip/Valkyrie=<c val="ffff8a">Heavy support fighter. Fires a volley of rocket barrages. Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">HALO Rockets</c><n/><n/>The Valkyrie missile frigate is a core component of the UED fleet. Equipped with HALO cluster rockets, Valkyries are designed for air-to-air combat, and can take substantial punishment from enemy fire before suffering any core systems failures.
Button/Tooltip/VespeneGeyser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest vespene gas from this Vespene Geyser.</c><n/><n/>Vespene gas has an unusually high potential energy rating, and as such it is highly valued for use as a fuel in high-performance engines and energy reactors. The Zerg have adapted themselves to use raw Vespene as a source of nourishment to drive their greatly accelerated metabolisms. Even the Protoss require Vespene to work as a catalyst for their psi-driven machines. Geysers of this powerful green gas can be found on many planets along the Rim, and several space stations have been built over Vespene-rich asteroid belts. A refinery of some sort must be built over an active geyser to process and package the gas for its collection by the different species.<n/><n/>While an individual geyser has an effectively unlimited amount of gas within it, after a certain point the geyser “collapses” and only trace amounts of Vespene can be refined from it. Most commanders would do well to seek fresh geysers to ensure that they have enough fuel to maintain their military.
Button/Tooltip/VikingFighter=<c val="ffff8a">Heavy support fighter. Fires a volley of rocket barrages. Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">HALO Rockets</c><n/><n/>The Valkyrie missile frigate is a core component of the UED fleet. Equipped with HALO cluster rockets, Valkyries are designed for air-to-air combat, and can take substantial punishment from enemy fire before suffering any core systems failures.
Button/Tooltip/Vulture=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fast skirmish unit. Can use the Spider Mine ability. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Anti-Personnel Fragmentation Grenades<n/>Spider Mines (optional)</c><n/><n/>The armored Vulture Hover Bikes, used primarily for scouting the myriad wastelands of the Terran Colonies, are designed for speed and reliability. The Limited Gravity Hover Technology used by the Vulture allows it to travel over rough terrain without loss of traction or speed. Although ill-suited for heavy combat, they make excellent skirmishers.
Button/Tooltip/Warbringer=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy artillery. Manufactures and fires Scarab Drones with a large blast radius. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Scarab Drones</c><n/><n/>Automatons used primarily for ground support, the massive, mechanical Reavers are renowned for their ability to level entire colonies in moments. The Reaver itself does not mount any weaponry, but instead houses a micro-manufacturing plant similar to the Protoss Carrier.
Button/Tooltip/WarpGate=Allows instantaneous travel across interstellar distances.
Button/Tooltip/WarpPrism=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Aerial transport.</c><n/><n/>Protoss Shuttles are used to carry ground forces into the midst of battle. These robotic flyers are heavily armored, but maintain no offensive weaponry. Shuttles are large enough to carry even the massive Reavers within their hulls.
Button/Tooltip/WarpinArbiter=<c val="ffff8a">Aerial support ship. Projects a field that cloaks all friendly units in its range. Can be upgraded to use Stasis Field and Recall. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor Cannon</c><n/><n/>Shrouded in mystery and permeated by latent psionic energy, the lumbering Arbiter ships often accompany Protoss warfleets into battle.<n/><n/>Psychic Judicators crew the Arbiter ships, and they use the Arbiter as a focal point to project a reality-warping field that serves to conceal all friendly units within close proximity. Since the Arbiter must be anchored firmly in space-time to safely generate such a large field, it is immune to the effects and remains visible, even when surrounded by the field of another Arbiter.
Button/Tooltip/WarpinArbiterTribunal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Stargate support facility.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Arbiters</c><n/><n/>The mighty Arbiter warships, surrounded as they are in a permanent distortion field, are extremely difficult to safely teleport. The Tribunal serves as a warp anchor of sorts, strengthening local space-time so that the Arbiters may be brought through the Stargates.
Button/Tooltip/WarpinObservatory=Knowledge collection center. Contains upgrades for Observers.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Observers
Button/Tooltip/WarpinReaver=Heavy mobile artillery. The Reaver itself does not mount any weaponry, but instead houses a micro-manufacturing plant, similar to the Protoss Carrier, which constructs explosive Scarabs in the field.
Button/Tooltip/WarpinShieldBattery2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Shield Battery uses Psi energy to replenish Protoss units' shields quickly.</c><n/><n/>The Shield Battery has a Khaydarin core that absorbs local Psi energy and contains it until it is needed by nearby Protoss warriors. By touching one of the Battery’s many energy spokes, any friendly Protoss warrior or vehicle can rapidly recharge its own shield levels. <n/><n/>The Battery does have a limited capacity, but will recharge itself over time. Careful deployment of multiple Batteries can spell the difference between victory and defeat in any campaign.
Button/Tooltip/Wraith=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Highly mobile flying unit. Excellent at surgical strikes. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Gemini Air-to-Air Missiles<n/>25mm Burst Laser (Model CF/A-17G only)</c><n/><n/>The versatile one-man Wraith fighters are a new addition to the Colonial space forces. Traditionally, most space battles took place between large capitol ships and smaller gunships, but Tarsonian technicians found that small, dynamic high-speed fighters could repeatedly deal damage to large ships while still evading most defensive battery attacks.<n/><n/>The CF/A-17 Wraith is the newest of these space superiority fighters, and although normally armed only with air-to-air missiles, newer variants also utilise a belly-mounted burst laser for ground attacks.
Button/Tooltip/WraithCloak=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Wraith ability. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies unless revealed by detectors or effects.</c><n/><n/><c val="f078ff">Drains <d ref="-1 * (Behavior,WraithCloak,Modification.VitalRegenArray[2] + Unit,Wraith,EnergyRegenRate)" precision="1"/> energy per second.</c><n/><n/>The new CF/A-17G Wraith features a built-in cloaking field which runs off of the fighter’s main power supply. When active, the cloaking field hides the Wraith from enemy view. This has proven invaluable in both base defense and strike operations.
Button/Tooltip/WraithCloakOn=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Cloaks the unit, preventing enemy units from seeing or attacking it. A cloaked unit will only be revealed by detectors or effects.</c><n/><n/><c val="f078ff">Drains <d ref="-1 * (Behavior,WraithCloak,Modification.VitalRegenArray[2] + Unit,Wraith,EnergyRegenRate)" precision="1"/> energy per second.</c><n/><n/>The new CF/A-17G Wraith features a built-in cloaking field which runs off of the fighter’s main power supply. When active, the cloaking field hides the Wraith from enemy view. This has proven invaluable in both base defense and strike operations.
Button/Tooltip/YamatoGun=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Blasts a target with a devastating plasma cannon, causing 260 points of explosive damage.</c><n/><n/>Recent research has also led to the development of the devastating Yamato Cannon, a terrifying weapon that uses an intense magnetic field to focus a small nuclear explosion into a cohesive beam of energy. The Cannon requires a huge energy reserve to fire, but its effects are impressive, to say the least.<n/><n/>Terran engineers are currently working overtime to retrofit existing Battlecruisers with Yamato devices, but many older ships are still in service.
Button/Tooltip/Zasz=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Master of the Garm Brood, the primary assault force of the Swarm.</c><n/></n>Zasz is one of the most clever Cerebrates, who never ceases to question his fellows. Zasz is driven to know all that he can about the other Cerebrates, so that they might all work together efficiently. However, Zasz’s sniveling nature often disturbs his fellows who find him to be somewhat unstable. Although Zasz is irritating, he is absolutely loyal to the Overmind and the sacred mission of his race.
Button/Tooltip/Zealot=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful melee warrior. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psionic Blades</c><n/><n/>Templar warriors who have yet to reach the upper levels of the Khala are known as Zealots. These fearless warriors attune themselves to the Khala’s disciplines and can invoke a near-berserker rage while in battle. Enhanced with cybernetic grafts and outfitted with their coveted power suits, the Zealots exemplify the unbridled ferocity of the Protoss at war.
Button/Tooltip/Zealot3=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful melee warrior. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psionic Blades</c><n/><n/>Templar warriors who have yet to reach the upper levels of the Khala are known as Zealots. These fearless warriors attune themselves to the Khala’s disciplines and can invoke a near-berserker rage while in battle. Enhanced with cybernetic grafts and outfitted with their coveted power suits, the Zealots exemplify the unbridled ferocity of the Protoss at war.
Button/Tooltip/Zeratul=<c val="ffff8a">Praetor of the Dark Templar, Zeratul possesses powerful psionic abilities. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Master Warp Blade</c><n/><n/>Like all of his dark brethren, Zeratul was banished from the Protoss homeworld long ago for refusing to submit his will to the ‘communal glory’ of the Khala. Because of this, Zeratul harbours a deep-seated hatred for the Protoss Conclave and the Judicator caste who were responsible for his wrongful exile.<n/><n/>Zeratul is proud and noble, but is marked by a dark and tragic aura. Although he is secretive and calculating, Zeratul is extremely honorable and would gladly risk everything to defend his long-lost homeworld of Aiur.
Button/Tooltip/Zergling=<c val="FFFF8A">Fast melee creature. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Zz’gashi Dune-runners</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Claws</c><n/><n/>The small, savage dune-runners of the sand-world Zz’gash were incorporated into the Zerg Swarm to serve as scouts and initial assault troops. Although the Zerglings are little more than feral animals, they work well in large groups under the command of larger Zerg warriors. <n/><n/>Because the genetic code of the Zergling is so simple to replicate, a single Larva can spawn two separate Zerglings.
Button/Tooltip/ZerusAlienTreeHover=A free-roaming creature.
Button/Tooltip/hydraliskspeed=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increase the attack range of Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>This subtle variation in the needle spines of the Hydralisk allows for an increased attack range.
Button/Tooltip/overlordspeed=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Overlords.</c><n/><n/>Biologically modified Vespene gas is stored in the Carapace and grants improved mobility to the Overlord.
Button/Tooltip/zerglingattackspeed=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the attack speed of Zerglings by 20%.</c><n/><n/>Changing this delicate glandular balance induces a kind of battle frenzy that increases the rate at which Zerglings attack.
Button/Tooltip/zerglingmovementspeed=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Zerglings.</c><n/><n/>This alteration of Zergling physiology serves to increase their reflexes and rate of movement.

Weapon/Tip/ArcliteShockCannon=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The experimental 120mm Mjolnir Artillery Cannon fires plasma shells in contrast to the standard explosives of the Shock Cannon. Effective in "scorched earth" operations. Like the standard Arclite tank, Duke's command vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated targeting system, able to identify heat sources and their range.
Weapon/Tip/C10CanisterRifle=<c val="ffff8a">Concussive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The C-10 Canister Rifle normally fires 25mm high explosive rounds, but it can also be armed with a variety of special munitions, such as Lockdown rounds. The C-10 is also equipped with a special underslung low frequency targeting laser, used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their target.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Claws=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The voracious Zerglings are fond of ripping enemies to shreds with their razor-limb sickles and fangs.</c>

Weapon/Tip/GoliathA=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Hellfire AA Scatter Missiles are the standard anti-air armament for Goliaths.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GoliathG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Goliath has anti-armor 30mm smoothbore autocannons attached in both arms as its primary armament against ground targets. The autocannons fire explosive shells.
Weapon/Tip/Guardian=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Guardian attacks by lobbing explosive gobs of acid which have a much longer range than the Mutalisk’s spray. This acid can only be directed at targets on the ground below. Guardians have no natural defenses against aerial opponents.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GuassRifle=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Marines' standard-issue C-14 Impaler Gauss Rifle fires 8mm metal “spikes” at hypersonic speeds. The rounds are designed to provide maximum penetration against all armor types. To preserve both ammo usage and minimise power requirements, the rifle uses a capacitor system to fire in short, controlled bursts.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Hydralisk=
Weapon/Tip/ImpalerTentacle=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c>
Weapon/Tip/InterceptorLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The maneuverable, computer-guided Interceptors tear through enemy flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower targets with potent plasma-charges. Manufactured and serviced inside of the Carrier bays, a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession.</c>
Weapon/Tip/IonCannons=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Corsairs are armed with twin neutron flares to attack enemy ships. The pilots could also focus their psionic powers through neutron emitters against ground targets, making the corsair a valuable asset for siege warfare.</c>
Weapon/Tip/KaiserBlades=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The large, bone-like scythes that protrude from Ultralisks' backs are nearly indestructible, allowing them to tear through most known substances with ease.</c>
Weapon/Tip/LanzerTorpedoes=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">HALO cluster rockets are fired in volleys, using a targeting system to scatter the rockets for a large area of effect. The dispersal radius of the targeting system is designed to achieve maximum damage to not only its intended target, but also adjacent targets within the blast area.</c>
Weapon/Tip/LongboltMissile=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Anti-air armament designed for Missile Turrets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Lurker=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Must be burrowed to attack.</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorZergLabel">Lurkers emit waves of super-dense spines against their enemies, having a full width of damage of ten meters. Any warriors on the surface who are caught by these spines are instantly impaled. These spines themselves are capable of tearing into flesh, steel, and even reinforced armor plating.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Marine=
Weapon/Tip/Mutalisk=
Weapon/Tip/NeedleSpines=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a Terran's 629. A portion of these muscles may be used to launch the armor piercing spines housed within their upper carapace plates. With enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters, at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle.<n/><n/>The spines were evolved from the Slothien's defensive urticating (stinging) hairs; they may be "grooved" for increased range and are slightly poisonous.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Nova=<c val="ffff8a">Concussive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The latest version of the C-10 rifle issued to Ghost agents, the Mark VI can be used both as an automatic weapon and as an anti-personnel sniper rifle. Kerrigan generally prefers the latter.<n/><n/>The Mk. VI is also equipped with a flashlight, can fire EMP rounds, and has retained the low frequency targeting laser that is used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their intended destination. The accuracy of Ghosts has improved thanks to the Mk. VI containing a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ParticleDisruptors=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot forces by launching bolts of antiparticles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PhotonCannon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Cannon fires an encapsulated antimatter sphere similar to that generated by the Dragoon. It is an effective weapon against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PsiBlades2=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The forearm units of Zealots' power suits are capable of channeling psionic energy, manifesting it as deadly blades that are used as their primary melee weapon.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ScarabLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.</c>

Weapon/Tip/WarpBlades=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The origins of the warp blade lie on the Xel'Naga ship the Nerazim departed Aiur in. Gaining access to new knowledge, the Nerazim used the psi-blade as a template to forge an instrument with which to shape their burgeoning psionic ability, and infuse it with Void energy.<n/><n/>Warp blades react to the user's strength of will, turning centuries of discipline and training into a powerful weapon. Further iterations on its design yielded scythe-like blades, which helped diversify the combat style of the Dark Templar.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WraithA=<c val="ffff8a">Explosive</c><n/><n/><c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The primary weapon of the Wraith.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WraithG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The new G variant of the CF/A-17 Wraith model introduced a belly-mounted 25mm burst laser as air-to-ground armament. Its design was spurred by the lack of an effective terran air-to-ground fighter below battlecruiser weight.</c>
